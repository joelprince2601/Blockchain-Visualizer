# Blockchain Visualizer

Blockchain Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to simplify and demystify the core concepts of blockchain technology. By offering real-time visualizations and simulations, this project allows users to explore how blocks, transactions, and networks operate in a blockchain system. Whether you’re a beginner seeking to understand the fundamentals or an expert looking to analyze blockchain behavior visually, this tool has you covered.

## 🚀 Features

- **Block Creation and Visualization**  
  - Simulate the creation of new blocks containing transactions.  
  - Visualize the structure of the blockchain with nodes representing blocks and edges indicating connections.

- **Transaction Flow**  
  - Add, validate, and visualize transactions in real-time.  
  - Explore how transactions are grouped into blocks.

- **Consensus Mechanism Simulation**  
  - Demonstrate basic consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake to ensure block validity.

- **Graphical Analytics**  
  - Analyze blockchain statistics such as the number of blocks, transaction counts, and average block creation time.  
  - Dynamic graph representation of blockchain growth over time.

- **Extensibility**  
  - Modular design allowing advanced features like multi-node networks, smart contracts, or private chains.
